# JS-PHS #7 - Clean Code Strikes Back!

## Summary

We're revisiting the topic from [JS-PHS #6](../jsphs6-clean-code-part-1), with new and more complex examples, and community submissions! :)

## Adding a solution

Each folder is a different problem. If you want to write your own function to solve it:

1. Copy `example.ts`
2. Rename the function (ex: change `nonEmptyUrlsWrong` to `nonEmptyUrlsBob`)
3. Write your own implementation
4. Export your implementation in `index.ts`
5. Run the tests with `npm run test`
